                </h2>

                    I run Zackary Brown Web Solutions, an independent web
                    business where I work directly with local service businesses
                    to build websites that look professional and actually help
                    generate leads.
                  </p>
                  <p style={{ fontSize: "0.9375rem", lineHeight: 1.7 }}>
                    When you work with me, you&apos;re not handed off to a team
                    of people you&apos;ve never met. I handle the design, the
                    development, and the communication. One person who knows
                    your project from start to finish.
                  </p>
                  <p style={{ fontSize: "0.9375rem", lineHeight: 1.7 }}>
                    I started this business because I saw too many local
                    businesses either stuck with outdated websites that
                    don&apos;t convert, or paying agency prices for results they
                    could get from a focused, independent professional. My goal
                    is to be the web partner that small business owners actually
                    want to work with. Responsive, transparent, and easy to
                    communicate with.

                I specialize in working with local service businesses, the kind
                of businesses where a potential customer's first impression
                often starts with a Google search. Detailing shops, dental
                offices, fitness studios, contractors, salons, med spas, and
                similar service-based businesses.

              <p style={{ fontSize: "0.9375rem", lineHeight: 1.7 }}>
                The common thread is simple: these businesses need a website
                that looks professional, communicates clearly, and makes it easy
                to take the next step, whether that&apos;s requesting a quote,
                booking an appointment, or making a call.
